## User Story
As a gardener, I want to connect with other gardners according to plant hardiness zones in order to create a place/forum to troubleshoot with others who share similar climate issues, so that we can grow and expand successful gardens.

## Acceptance Criteria 

WHEN the page loads, 

THEN I am presented with a login page where I can either login or create an account.

WHEN I am logged in, 

THEN I am redirected to the homepage where I can see a plant hardiness map and identify which zone I am growing in. 

WHEN I select my zone from a dropdown menu, 

THEN I am directed to a page with information about plants for this zone and a blog-style forum where I can contribute to a thread conversation among other account holders.
